*** TUTORIAL

*** POSTING
This will create a post to the off topic board containing the content x and replying to y, if y is unspecified, then it will be considered that it does not reply to anything.
curl https://api.cyberland2.club/o/?content=x&replyTo=y

*** GETTING POSTS
This will get y number of posts from the off topic board that reply to post number x with the newest first as a JSON object. If x is unspecified, just y number of recent posts will be returned. The number of posts you can recieve at once may be limited at some point depending on how this goes.

curl https://api.cyberland2.club/o/?thread=x&num=y

You can sort using sortOrder (values: "bumpCount", "time", "id") in ascending or descending order using sortHierarchy (values: "ASC", "DESC").

*** SORTING
If I wanted to get all posts on /t/, sorted by bumpcount I would do this:
curl https://api.cyberland2.club/t/?sortOrder=bumpCount

This would get you all the oldest posts first:
curl https://api.cyberland2.club/t/?sortOrder=time&sortHierarchy=ASC
