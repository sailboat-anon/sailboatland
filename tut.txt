* Posting
POST /o content=x&replyTo=y
 - This will create a post to the off topic board containing the content x and replying to y, if y is unspecified, then it will be considered that it does not reply to anything.
* Retrieving posts
GET cyberland2.club/o/?thread=x&num=y
 - This will get y number of posts from the off topic board that reply to post number x with the newest first as a JSON object. If x is unspecified, just y number of recent posts will be returned. The number of posts you can recieve at once may be limited at some point depending on how this goes.
